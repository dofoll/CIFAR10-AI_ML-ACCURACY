IMPROVING ON CIFAR-10 IMAGE CLASSIFICATION 
ACCURACY USING CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK
( C N N )

Image processing in recent years has become part of human daily lives, especially with the 
exploding breakthrough in mobile technology with such computing power never before accessed. With 
AI enabled devices image can be recognised. This interest is the motivation for the classification of 
image dataset. The study sought to improve classification accuracy of CIFAR-10 dataset using 
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The default parameters of the classification model were tweaked 
for better accuracy. While the training dataset achieved 96% accuracy, the model achieved 74% on the 
validation dataset, which is still an acceptable performance. Among the 10 classes in the dataset, the 
model performed best in classifying automobile but struggled with cat. This observation is a baseline 
for another research.
